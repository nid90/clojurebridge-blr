Something along the lines of: https://aphyr.com/posts/301-clojure-from-the-ground-up-welcome

- The purpose of programmers and programming
- People are welcome and comfortable
- Programming is valuable in many STEM fields; this is a taster
- There's many languages, we have chosen Clojure
- Clojure is incredibly easy to learn

** Teacher Notes

- Mention that we have people with varied abilities:
  * 0 programming experience
  * little math experience
  * some programming experience
  * advanced

* Using quil (https://github.com/quil/quil)
- start with a blank canvas
- three fns - *sketch*, *setup* and *draw*
- draw a circle on the canvas
- draw infinite amount of random circles
- draw random shapes

** Mars Rover Problem
- Potential solution - https://github.com/nid90/clojurebridge-blr/tree/master/mars-rover


* Varied experience
- Just logically segregate people of different experience on different tables. Assign teachers to the groups. However, always ensure that everyone sits in the same basic area.
- Allow your content to have forks to enable people with different experience levels. Make exercises for all skills. Timebox them.
